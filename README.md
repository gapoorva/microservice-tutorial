# microservice-tutorial

This repository is a reference and tutorial with code examples to understand and utilize microservices. In this tutorial, we will cover:

* What are microservices?
* What is docker?
* How can you use docker to build effective microservices?
* What is golang?
* How can you use golang with docker?
* How do you make a small microservice in golang?
* What is a URL shortener?
* How do you test microservices?

We will explore the above in stages. Each stage will have it's own `README.md`. Be sure to reach each to understand what covered in each stage. We will build upon previous stages to develop a full URL shortening microservice.

Please let me know if you have any questions! Feel free to open github issues on this repo.
